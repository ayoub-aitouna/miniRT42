#Pseudocode for Bump Mapping in Ray Tracing

#Given:
#- Intersection point on the surface of an object(hit point)
#- Normal vector at the hit point(surface normal)
#- Bump map texture

# 1. Compute the texture coordinates at the hit point based on the object's UV mapping.
#This step depends on how you have set up UV coordinates for your objects.

# 2. Use the texture coordinates to sample the bump map texture at the hit point.
#This will give you the corresponding grayscale value(height or displacement) from the bump map.

# 3. Calculate the tangent and bitangent vectors at the hit point.
#These vectors are used to perturb the surface normal according to the bump map information.
#The tangent and bitangent vectors are perpendicular to the surface normal and each other.

# 4. Perturb the surface normal using the tangent and bitangent vectors and the bump map value.
#The extent of the perturbation depends on the bumpiness you want to achieve.
#You can scale the tangent and bitangent vectors by the bump map value to control the effect.
#The modified normal is calculated as:
#perturbed _normal = surface_normal + bumpiness * (tangent * dU + bitangent * dV)

# 5. Use the perturbed normal for shading calculations,
	such as lighting and reflections.

#Example pseudocode implementation for a ray - triangle intersection:

def	intersect_ray_triangle(ray, triangle)
	:
#... perform ray - triangle intersection calculation...

# 1. Compute texture coordinates
		tex_coords = compute_texture_coordinates(intersection_point, triangle)

# 2. Sample bump map
			bump_map_value = sample_bump_map(tex_coords)

# 3. Calculate tangent and bitangent vectors
				tangent,
		bitangent = calculate_tangent_and_bitangent(triangle)

# 4. Perturb the surface normal
			perturbed_normal = triangle.surface_normal + bumpiness * (tangent
					* bump_map_value.u + bitangent * bump_map_value.v)

# 5. Use perturbed normal for shading calculations

#... continue with shading calculations using the perturbed normal...
